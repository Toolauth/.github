# Tool Authorization in shared workshops
Makerspaces and Fab Labs are fun spaces! Lots can be done, ideas brought to reality, and friendships forged. 

Managing this kind of shared workshop can be a handful. This problem only compounds as membership increases. This projects is born out of [MakeHaven](https://www.makehaven.org/), which is one of those shared workshops and has over 600 members.

The repos linked here represent a series of hardware solutions to automate access control to power tools and other things in a shared workshop. The software lives in another place [not quite public yet] but it can be built around [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).
